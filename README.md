gape digging bot using the baritone api

very scuffed but works well.

make a folder in your .minecraft called Digger and place a file called databaseIP in it with the ip of your mongo database, username and password. in that folder, also make a file called partitions with the range of partitions that the player/bot will use. example: 1 20

make sure there is only one document in the partitions collection
