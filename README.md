Gape digging bot using the baritone api

Needs lots of refactoring but works well.


For users:

Make a folder in your .minecraft called Digger and place a file called databaseIP in it with the ip of your mongo database, username and password. In that folder, also make a file called partitions with the range of partitions that the player/bot will use. Example: 1 20

Make sure there is only one document in the partitions collection
